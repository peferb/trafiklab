# peferb/trafiklab changelog

## v0.2.4
### Route Planner V3.1 AKA Travel Planner V3.1 (SL Reseplanerare 3.1)

Added support for [Route Planner V3.1](https://www.trafiklab.se/api/trafiklab-apis/sl/route-planner-31/). But it's not a 
pretty implementation because Route Planner API breaks the general SL API structure.

#### How does Route Planner V3.1 diff against the other API:s?
* All other API:s consists of one endpoint per API. Route Planner V3.1 consists of multiple endpoints. 
* All other API:s offers JSON as data return format. In Route Planner two of the endpoints only returns XML, I have 
suffixed those with "Xml".

## v.0.2.3
### Changed all parameters to stlib types
Now DataFormat type and "Api" Type is replaced by regular strings.

I came to his decision after reading [Jack Lindamoods article "Aspects of a good Go library"](https://medium.com/@cep21/aspects-of-a-good-go-library-7082beabb403).

### NewApi returns Api...
... and not Struct{Api} as before. Don't even know what Struct{Api} is. The previous return type was the result of a 
late late night in a new lang ðŸ˜…

## v0.2.1 / v0.2.2
_(duplicated version because of me messing things up)_

### Breaking changes
* Replaced the package import usage with `sl.NewApi()`.
* Moved data structure selection from func name to param. 

#### Example new usage 
```go
import (
	"github.com/peferb/trafiklab/sl"
	. "github.com/peferb/trafiklab/sl/api"
)

func main() {
	departuresApi := sl.NewApi(RealTimeDeparturesV4, JSON, "you api key here")
}
```

### New functionality
* Added "SL Nearby stops v2.0 (NÃ¤rliggande hÃ¥llplatser 2)"
* Added "SL Stops and lines v2.0 AKA LineData (SL HÃ¥llplatser och Linjer 2)"

### Misc
* Much smaller codebase / lib size
* Less bloated dev interface
* Added tests
